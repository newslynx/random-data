Random data
===========

Random data for demos. The `title`, `description` and `body` fields contain dummy data. Fields in all caps are values that should be replaced but the data to replace them with will have to correspond to actual database elements such as content items or recipe ids. These values are in all caps.

Other fields like `author` are prefilled with a string that can serialize to JSON or, if desired, that could be replaced with actual authors as well.
